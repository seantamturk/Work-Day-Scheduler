# Work Day Scheduler

## Description 

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. It is built using HTML, CSS, and jQuery and utilizes a third-party API - Day.js library - to handle date and time functionality.

As a new web coder, the Work Day Scheduler project challenged me to create a simple calendar application. By completing this project, I gained practical experience with key web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, jQuery, and third-party APIs like Day.js. 

In addition to building a functional calendar app, this project helped me develop problem-solving skills and the ability to work with both front-end and back-end technologies. Overall, completing the Work Day Scheduler project was an important step in my development as a web coder and prepared me for future web development challenges. 

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Functionality

The Work Day Scheduler allows users to:

- View the current date and time
- Add/edit/delete events for each hour of the day from 9AM to 5PM
- Events are color-coded based on their time: past events are gray, current event is red, and future events are green
- Events are saved to local storage and persist when the page is refreshed

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery
- Day.js library

## Acknowledgements

This project was completed as part of a Third-Party APIs Challenge, with the starter code and instructions provided by my teacher. I utilized the Day.js library to handle date and time functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Work Day Scheduler, simply open the link at the bottom of the readme. The current date and time will be displayed, along with the hourly schedule from 9AM to 5PM. To add an event, simply click on the corresponding time slot and enter your text. Click the save button to save the event, or the delete button to remove it.
